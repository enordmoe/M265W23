* Programming skills you may or may not have seen before such as creating new functions, working with vectors and arrays, and using loops and conditionals will be helpful in most of the steps of a serious data science project.   
* Once we get into the course a bit, we'll spend a few classes focusing on these techniques.

* Packages are customizations

* Focus on use of R; might not always be the best tool available, but this approach will let us go deep rather than flitting from one language to another. R allows for "tailored grammars" for the data science processes.
* Why no big data? Develop tools that can be applied to bigger problems.   
* Machine learning? It's a different course, one that Prof Erdi has taught.  
* Stat inference: no emphasis on hypothesis testing. Two areas of statistics: Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics.  
    - Mention 80/20 rule for stats anaylses

# What you also will not learn in this class  


* Base graphics in R (only used a little here)

* The **mosaic** package

* **ggformula** syntax for graphics (as used in MATH 260)

???

Especially relevant for those who have taken other courses with me.
